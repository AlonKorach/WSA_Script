# WSA_Script
Script files to install Windows Subsystem for Android in Windows 11 with Google Play Store Support

## Automated Creation of WSA :
Those who wish to automatically create their WSA with Play Store and Magisk with any of the open GApps
can go with the Automated Folder which has the instructions in it
(Temporarily, people are suggested to use the Manual Guide to build your WSA Package)
(But you can still use the Automated Process without Magisk)

## Manual Creation of WSA :
Those who wish to manually create their WSA with Play Store with pico GApps can use the Manual Folder
which has the instructions in it.
